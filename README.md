### Usability Profile Analysis:
Usability Profile Analysis
The function of using the App will be to use communication that you will have with the patient, through questions using Artificial Intelligence means of communication, making an automation process through a chatbot where the AI will identify the first symptom to proceed with the care .
It will be a virtual assistant, who will interact with the user through questioning through questions to the patient where he will diversify the symptoms he feels, in order to help in the suggestion in which medical area he should go.

After having logged in with the created user, it will open a message field where the user can interact with the App describing the symptoms manifested.
